## Learning goals

- I want to get better at responsive layouts so my website is usable on all screen sizes and try to use as little media queries as possible.
- I want to learn how to implement animations that I haven't used before and learn more about scrolling animations or combining animations with scrolling.
- I want to become more confident working with APIs, Javascript has always been harder for me so I want to get better at JS by using an API for example.

#### What did I do today?
Today I started setting up my website, but unfortunately I began the wrong way by working with NPM. After that I started again in the correct way. I gathered inspiration for which features I want to add to my site and I defined my learning goals.

#### How much time did it take?
At the beginning I spent my time the wrong way by creating the wrong setup. After that I spent about 2 hours getting inspiration. Then I spent roughly another 3 hours for the rest of the day setting up my concept.

#### What did I learn?
Mostly I refreshed the basics; because I haven’t coded for a while, I had to look up a lot of fundamental things again.

#### What am I going to do tomorrow?
Tomorrow I want to clearly write down my learning goals and focus on animations, responsiveness, and GSAP.

### 5 feb

#### What did I do today?
Today I worked on finishing my learning goals, finished my box in the bottom right corner with my name and some animations.

#### How much time did it take?
I started the day with struggling with my idea but thanks to the help of vasillas I got onto the right track. After that I worked on finishing my animations and I am quite happy with them. I ended the day with starting on my carousel with imgs.

#### What did I learn?
Animations are harder than I thought, so I learned quite a lot from that. 

#### What am I going to do tomorrow?
Tomorrow I am going to work on the img scroll animation and the different theme I want to add.
